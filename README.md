# jetson-exercise-tracker

## Background
My grandparents need some support to help them exercise. Their home support can only twice a day for 10 minutes, and they are often inadequate. My idea is to develop a low cost tracking system to guide the to exercise. This is meant to help pople in homecare, home support, or healthcar services ensure that the elderly people are doing the exercises that they ar doing. 

## Introduction
This is a project based on the jetson-inference container. 

## 
##Roadmap
1. MVP
The first goal of this is to investigate the feasibility of using low cost off the shelf jetson nano and low cost camera to help elderly to exercise. Also, this is to monitor them and support them so that they are exercising similarly to how the home support does the exercise with them. 

2. Camera tracking/Camera Movement
    This will be made to ensure that the user can use the camera anywhere and can track the exercise that is being made and done with.
    

3. Programmable Exercise Recipes

    I want the exerciss to be chosn to be very simple and not complicated. This is mainly for my eldrly people who are injured or have sickness and can especially do exercise from their home. 

4. Video Streaming

    I want to ensure that I can see how the exercises are for my grandparents when they do these exercises. 

5. Use Face Recognition to identify users

    This is for ensuring that the user wants to do the exercise for a short period of time and can do it. This is to ensure that as the admin, I can see and adjust the code so that the exercise is done properly. Also, to  allow and ensure that the camera is not pointlessly tracking and counting of the exercising happening. Also, I want to make sure that when they are exercising it is counted properly.

6. History tracking
    
    This is to track the amount of time someone has used the app. Also, to see
